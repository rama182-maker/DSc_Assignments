1. Write a python program to implement the Simple Linear Regression(SLR) from scratch. Consider the
   dataset from the given link.
   Data Link: https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/salary-data-simple-linear-regression
Or
   Data Link: https://www.kaggle.com/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset
   Find the relationship between the independent variable and dependent. Mention the variables
   considered for the respective dataset. Implement SLR for the given data as per the steps given below.
   [Any one dataset can be considered as per your choice. Mention the dataset used before implementation]
      a. Import the dataset
      b. Assign the values to independent variable and dependent variable
      c. Print the first few rows
      d. Separate the dataset into train and test data as 80% and 20% respectively.
      e. Plot the dataset (train dataset)( independent variable vs dependent variable)
      f. Calculate the regression line(train dataset):

          i. Compute the slope
          ii. Compute the intercept
          iii. Compute and Plot regression line with data points

      g. Predict the values using test data.
      h. Calculate the error / accuracy of the model using root mean squared error
      
2. Write a python program to implement the Multiple Linear Regression from scratch as per the steps
   given below and consider the dataset from the given link.
   Data Link: https://www.kaggle.com/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset
      a. Import the required libraries and the data
      b. Scale the dataset [Standardization of the data]
      c. Separate the dataset into train and test data as 80% and 20% respectively.
      d. Implement the logic of the algorithm using Gradient Descent Function.
      e. Train the model and plot the data
      f. Predict the values using test data.
      g. Calculate the error / accuracy of the model using root mean squared error
