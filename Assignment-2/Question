1. Write a python program to create a list with n number of items (where n should be atleast 6) with different types (integer, float, string) and perform the following functions:
    a. Count the length of the list
    b. Access the last element in the list using negative indexing.
    c. Add one item to a list using the append()method.
    d. Add several items using the extend()method.
    e. Add a list as an item to the existing list (nested list).
    f. Use the index operator to access the items at various location within the list.
    [Access 3 different index from the list] [provide comments to mention the location]
    g. Add an element to the list at the specified index using insert() method. [provide comments to specify the index]
    h. Replace an existing element from the list at a specified location. [provide comments to specify the index]
    i. Add duplicate elements to the list.
    j. Remove the item at the given index from the list using pop() method.
    k. Sort the elements of the given list in a specific ascending or descending order.
    l. Reverse the elements of the list using reverse() method.
2. Write a Python program to create a tuple with n different data types and implement the two methods: count() and index().
3. Write a Python program to create two sets (S1 and S2) with n number of different elements [add elements to the sets S1 and S2, such that there are atleast 2 common elements between them] and perform the following functions:
    a. Perform union and intersection
    b. Add elements using add () and update () methods
    c. Perform S1 â€“ S2
    d. Find the Symmetric Difference of S1 and S2
