1. Implement Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) from scratch using Python

  a. Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
  b. Group the training data into its respective classes . [Form a dictionary and save data
  grouped by classes it belongs to]
  c. Calculate mean vector of given training data of K-dimensions excluding the target class
  and calculate class-wise mean vector for the given training data
  d. Calculate scatter matrices needed to maximize the difference between means of given
  classes and minimize the variance of given classes.
  e. Calculate eigen values of M and get eigen vector pairs for first n (needed ) dimensions.
  f. Selecting Linear Discriminants for the new features subspace
    i.      Sorting eigen vectors by decreasing eigenvalues
    ii.     Choosing k eigen vectors with the largest eigenvalues
  g. Transforming the samples onto the new subspace.
  
2. Implement Logistic Regression by using LDA for the following dataset. [ sklearn Library
   can be used for LDA and Logistic Regression Computation]
   
  a. Dataset: Uploaded in Google Classroom
  b. Split the dataset
  c. Feature Scaling
  d. Apply LDA
  e. Train the model with Logistic regression
  f. Compute the Confusion matrix
